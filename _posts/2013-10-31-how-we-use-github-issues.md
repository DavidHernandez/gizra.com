title: How We Achieve Faster Development and Happier Clients by Opening Our GitHub Issues

As we [mentioned](http://www.gizra.com/content/the-gizra-way/) before, in Gizra each project's GitHub repository - code, issues etc - is completely open & transparent to the client from the day we start working together. As project manager, I've discovered this provides me with some unexpected benefits.

<!-- more -->

As I see it, the essence of project management is communication. The essence of communication is repetition. Almost always, you need to repeate an idea several times in several ways to really communicate it. It's a fact of life - saying something once rarely gets the message across.

While I generally enjoy communicating, it demands time and can get challenging when working simultaneously on a lot of different projects for different clients.

This need for reducing communication time led us to try and get our clients to participate in task tracking process with us. We found that while there is some learning curve, it's not too steep, and the benefits are easily worth it.

Initially, I'd break down the tasks into GitHub Issues tickets, which the lead developer for the project will then assign to developers as we go. As the project starts up, the client gradually joins the process - opening issues which we assign to the developers. When a developer has a question regarding a task, they'd ask the client directly on the Issue thread. Once the task is done, a pull request is created - if it affects the front end a screenshot is attached, so the client can see what the new feature looks like and, if needed, correct us before we move on. Otherwise, following a code review it is merged to master and pushed to the site.

The entire process is open to all stakeholders. If a question leads to new knowledge, it is automatically documented and shared with everyone. As Project Manager, my involvement is reduced once we establish the direct dev<->client communication line, but I do get email notifications on all new comments - so if a task seems to get stuck for some reasone, the lead dev or myself will jump in and arrange a call with the client to hash things out.

We find this works beautifully both for us and the clients. We cut the middleman and reduce friction from the process, making for a much faster development cycle and a more involved & happier client. The common client/developer communication frustrations are reduced significantly.

As a bonus, it makes the Project Manager's life much easier, especially on a distributed team like ours. A constant stream of GitHub notifications in our email, letting us know who's working on what and how it's going. The client gets the same feed, and with that a feel for how the project is proceeding and whether a particular task is stuck for some reason - allowing her to change the task definition or ask us to switch to a more important task if the expected functionality isn't worth the effort.

We don't have this working for all clients, yet. But our exprience is positive enough that we do our best to convince clients to take part in this process - for both sides' benefit.
