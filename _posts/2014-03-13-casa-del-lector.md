## Case del Lector

This week saw the launch of a pretty unique project for us. It's not every day a product we've worked on gets [covered on El Pais](http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2014/03/05/actualidad/1394047004_090821.html), or this kind of launch event:

It's different under the hood as well. While it can be used on any device anywhere, it's targeted to be used inside a specific exhibition in the [Casa del Lector](http://casalector.fundaciongsr.com/) museum in Madrid, on tablets handed out to the museum visitors:

We took great care to stay within the touch UI conventions. When entering the site, the user is presented with a map of connections between items. As she zooms, details are revealed - subitems, their connections and finally their titles:
