            <h1><a href="/content/elmlang-headless-drupal">Elm Loves Headless Drupal </a></h1>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Part of my job is to get my hands dirty with technologies I stumble upon. I&#39;ve decided to have a go at React. Well, one thing led to the other and it seems I went down the client side rabbit hole. I&#39;d like to share with you my path - watch out though, it&#39;s a slippery slope.</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elmlang/image1.jpg">
  <div class="caption">"Hello World" in <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a></div>
</div>

<p>It all started with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;t=621&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw">Thinking Flux</a> video which explains the problems Facebook faced in its front-end and the new application architecture they are now using.</p>

<p>Since the Flux concept was out, different libraries were written implementing it, but in my view it seems that <a href="http://rackt.github.io/redux/">Redux</a> is the winner in terms of simplicity, popularity, docs and community. I really recommend going over it - at least the intro and basics. You might be tempted to actually learn a bit of React (<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>) to follow the examples more easily.</p>

<p>Then I saw Redux was crediting <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> for some of its inspiration, so I decided to give it a quick look. I was immediately blown away by Elm. The syntax is weird (unless you know Haskell), it has a crazy learning curve, but a lot of it makes so much sense.</p>

<p>The following recording is a presentation I first gave internally for Gizra devs, then as a BoF in DrupalCon Barcelona, and finally recorded to share it with everyone.  </p>

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_gTakI4Vfw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>My goal is to get more people excited about Elm so the community and contributions grows. I feel it is now very much like Drupal about 10 years ago - a small community, far from being mainstream, but with a lot of potential.</p>

<p>Maybe if we&#39;ll draw from Drupal&#39;s experience in building and cultivating a community we&#39;ll be able to bring this awesome tool closer to the mainstream.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>There&#39;s a saying &quot;Good moms have sticky floors, messy kitchens, laundry piles, dirty ovens, and happy kids”. God knows I score an A+ and by that phrase alone I am THE perfect mother. But how do you leave those happy kids and get back to work?!</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/happy-kids/wonder-woman.jpg">
</div>

<p>I have 3 kids (recent one is brand new - in fact I&#39;m writing this post while being on maternity leave), which I absolutely adore and admire with every breath they take, a husband that I&#39;m (still, after so many years together) crazy about and, lucky me, I love my job and co-workers. </p>

<p>I must be the fortunate one to hit the jackpot as a most people I know are not even satisfied with one thing, let alone three!  </p>

<p>I should know. I was &quot;most people”. A nine to five office monkey, working tons of overtime and weekends, trying to get to the top. I was carefree at that time (for the singles in the crowd: this means no children) and my main concerns were questions such as what&#39;s the best party to attend to on Thursday night? Which movie to go to on Friday night? What to eat, where? You get my point.</p>

<p>So I met my husband; then came the kids; and then there was Gizra.</p>

<p>Gizra is known for our up-front, straightforward attitude, and as such I want to be very honest - on the verge of blunt - and share with you some thoughts.
I am a working mother. A wife. A person. Not by that specific order but that sounds just about right to me as I feel like the &quot;person&quot; part kicks in only after the kids are in beds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asking myself some questions lately:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to be at the office while I am on my maternity leave. Does that make me a bad mother?</li>
<li>I miss my kids and my husband and I want to be with them instead of being at the office, while I am at work. Does that make me a bad employee?</li>
<li>Sometimes I cannot stand the sound of my own name when one of my employees calls me, wants something from me. Does that make me a bad manager?</li>
<li>I find myself often screening my friends calls and avoiding meeting them (sometimes it involves telling a little white lie) because I just wanna stay home. Does that make me a bad friend?</li>
<li>Sometimes all I want is just be left alone for a while. No kids shouting M-O-M-M-Y, No employees telling me they need something from me. Does that make me a bad person?</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a way to keep everyone happy? Your kids, your bosses, your employees, your friends, your husband, and last but not least - even yourself?<br>
I just know I love my job; love my husband; love my kids (definitely not in that specific order).</p>

<p>Truth be told, I don&#39;t have all the answers, far from it, but I&#39;d like to share some tips on how you can make family and work combine (just a little bit) better together:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Working nine to five?</code> - Not necessarily! Try to be flexible in terms of working hours. You are killing two birds with one stone: arriving early means you get to leave early - just in time to get your kids out of daycare.</li>
<li><code>Safety net</code> - There&#39;s nothing like family support, if you&#39;re fortunate enough to have one who is able to help you. Play nice with your mother in law, your brother, your distant cousin etc.</li>
<li><code>Don&#39;t be a stranger</code> - There&#39;s a saying &quot;Better a nearby neighbor than a far away brother&quot;. Get to know your neighbors just a little bit better, you might find it useful one day.</li>
<li><code>Don&#39;t be sociopaths</code> - Everybody knows that the worst thing in the world is to be in a kindergarten&#39;s WhatsApp group! I&#39;d be the first to admit it - once I&#39;ve been added to one, I curse like hell and immediately silence it for a year! Who wants to get messages announcing the appearance of lice or which kid lost his coat or a toy. However, it may save your ass if you&#39;re stuck in traffic or in an important meeting and you might need another mom or dad to take your kids out of the kindergarten/school.</li>
<li>Playdates - Try to convince your kids to go to a playdate, preferably at another mom&#39;s house! That way you have some peace and quiet to finish some tasks you were suppose to finish long time ago or to finish an important presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>A well known DrupalCon fact is that the action mostly takes place in the hallways and social gatherings. The logic is that the sessions are recorded, and the rest isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>On DrupalCon L.A. I was spending most of my time in the hallways stalking people to show them the newly born <a href="http://shoov.io/">Shoov</a> and ask for their feedback. One of those people was my good friend Mike Anello, which later expressed his feelings about Shoov in this fun DrupalEasy <a href="http://drupaleasy.com/podcast/2015/05/drupaleasy-podcast-153-drupalcon-los-angeles-day-2-recap">podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Few months later, with the next DrupalCon already around the corner and Shoov maturing every day, I&#39;ve contacted him to get his feedback on what we have so far, and I got this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think one that could help me and other developers is almost something like a glossary. I’ve heard of many of the technologies in your visual monitoring “stack”, but not entirely clear on what the purpose of each one is (Yeoman, WebdriverCSS, mocha, etc… - Behat I know!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s start from the end, because those three words made an impact on me - &quot;Behat I know&quot;.</p>

<p>As a reader of this post you are probably familiar with <a href="http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/">Behat</a> or at least know what functional testing frameworks are.</p>

<p>Do you remember that time in the past you didn&#39;t?<br>
Do you remember that time in the past where functional testing was just a <em>nice to have</em> for you and not the <em>life saver</em> it is now days?  </p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>In recent months I&#39;ve been demoing visual monitoring to many developers. The reaction was always positive, but I&#39;ve realized that not enough people have taken the step from recognizing the need to actually implementing it on their own projects.</p>

<p>If you have been following my recent blog posts or tweets you&#39;ve probably noticed we are trying to bring visual monitoring along with <a href="http://shoov.io">Shoov</a> to the masses. To do so we&#39;re trying to reduce the complexity and codify our &quot;lessons learned&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeoman generators is one way to achieve this. With the new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-shoov">yo shoov</a> - a single command makes sure all the files needed for visual monitoring are immediately scaffolded in your repository. In fact, it also sets up Behat tests along with a <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/drupal.org-shoov/blob/master/.shoov.yml">.shoov.yml</a> that will allow Shoov to run your visual monitoring tests periodically.</p>

<p>Since visual monitoring might be new for a lot of people, the generator not only scaffolds the files but also attempts to check if your system is properly installed, and tells you how to fix it if not.</p>

            <h1><a href="/content/phantomjs-chrome-docker-selenium-standalone">Why PhantomJS When You Can Chrome </a></h1>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Following our <a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/live-monitor-shoov-irony/">unfortunate bug</a> in Shoov which caused login to stop working, we decided to write a Behat test that will continuously check the live site and make sure login with GitHub is working properly.</p>

<p>Writing the Behat test was pretty easy, however it had a major problem - it didn&#39;t work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="gherkin language-gherkin" data-lang="gherkin"><span class="nt">@javascript</span><span class="nf"></span>
<span class="k">Scenario:</span><span class="nf"> Login to shoov</span>
<span class="k">  Given </span><span class="nf">I am an anonymous user</span>
<span class="nf">   </span><span class="k">When </span><span class="nf">I visit the homepage</span>
<span class="nf">    </span><span class="k">And </span><span class="nf">I login with my GitHub account</span>
<span class="nf">   </span><span class="k">Then </span><span class="nf">I should wait for the text &quot;</span><span class="s">My Account</span><span class="nf">&quot; to &quot;</span><span class="s">appear</span><span class="nf">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When Behat sees the <code>@javascript</code> tag in the begining of the scenario, it launches it (with the help of Mink extension) in PhantomJS, Firefox or Chrome.<br>
PhantomJS is usually the easiest to configure and hook into the CI workflow later on.</p>

<p>But the test we wrote just failed on all versions of PhantomJS we tried. Which made us switch to Firefox instead. Travis CI is kind enough to have a headless Firefox installed in their machine which we could use. Unfortunately, Firefox didn&#39;t like our test either, but for another reason - it couldn&#39;t parse the xpath we use to find our text elements.</p>

<p>So after spending some time trying to figure out a workaround, I suddenly stared at the browser I was using to find the answer - Chrome!</p>
