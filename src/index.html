        Everybody tells us that people won’t read this. They will enter the site, see mostly text, and move on.

        Maybe they're right. However, we don’t think it's because people don’t want to read; rather it’s because what is written is usually boring. In any case, we believe writing this is worth the risk.

        It’s difficult to explain exactly who we are. It's not that we haven't tried, but we inevitably ended up using words that have long lost their meaning. Really, how can words like "trust" or "innovation" be taken seriously when stuck inside a tag line.

        And anyway, this whole thing of trying to describe oneself in short - can you explain in one sentence who you are? Even if you could, it certainly would miss out on so much.

        So we wrote three (short) stories that we hope will give you a glimpse into our mindset. We have a good feeling about this, but who knows - it's for you to decide.
