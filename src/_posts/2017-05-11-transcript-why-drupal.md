This post is just a translation of the transcript of the lightning talk I gave during [DrupalCamp Spain 2017](https://2017.drupalcamp.es/) in Madrid. The title of the talk was "[Why Drupal](https://2017.drupalcamp.es/sessions/why-drupal-davidbaltha)" and talked about my personal reasons for developing with Drupal. You can find the slides, with the transcript in Spanish [here](http://slides.com/david_hernandez/why-drupal/).

## *Why Drupal?*

*We all agree that Drupal is a great tool. In our daily jobs we use Drupal because we think it give us an advantage over our competitors, because it suits the needs of the client, because it speeds our development, and/or because we produce a high quality product.*

*But, as programmers, why do we choose to work on a company that uses Drupal?*

*I do not why you choose to use Drupal, but as this is my session, I will tell you why I do.*

*But before jumping into conclusions, let's start from the beginning.*

![About me](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/about-me.png)

*I am David Hern√°ndez and for me, it is a privilege to be here, sharing this lightning talk with all of you.*

![Privilege](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/priviledge.png)

*And I mean it.*

*I work for a company that allowed me to come today to this conference instead of spending it working. And they pay me well enough to be able to afford spending 3 days in Madrid without trouble.*

*I born in a family that allowed me to finish my studies and allowed me to live abroad to continue my training.*

*I live in a country that has one of the best passports in the world for travelling and most of the borders are open for me with no trouble.*

*The colour of my skin makes that in most places, everybody is helpful and mindful. A colour that does not make me a suspect by default.*

*My sexual genre doesn't cause the people to question why I have not settled yet and why I do not have a family and kids. This genre always helped me to find good jobs and better conditions than the fifty percent of the population of my country, under the same conditions.*

![The problem of privilege](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/problem-of-priviledge.png)

*And this continues forever. And it is a problem. But does it have a solution?*

*In my opinion, there is a really simple solution.*

![The end of privilege](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/end-of-priviledge.png)

*To end with the privileges. But, as this is extremely complicated, we need to continue moving in that direction by little steps.*

*Do I have more privileges than other person? Then, I have to use those privileges to help that person and to help the rest of the people who also lacks this privilege.*

*Is there people abusing of their privilege? Then, I have to confront them, even if their abuse does not directly affects me or even if it helps me, to stop the abuse of the less privileged people.*

*When we get something before other person, we need to ask ourselves why did we receive it. Was it because we had more merits or was it because we have more privileges? We have to make this difference of privileges more visible so people is aware of those differences.*

*But... How is all of this related with Drupal?*

![Free software](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/free-software.png)

*The answer is the Free / Libre Software.*

*The Free Software is the one that allows anyone to use it. Anyone with no exception. But not only limited to use it. It also allows anyone to study, modify, distribute or even sell the software.*

*Those four liberties of the Free Software is what allows us to fight against the big companies trying to establish a monopoly. A monopoly that prevents people with less resources or from other countries to use their software.*

*Promoting the use of Free Software we help people with less privileges to use a software that will help them reduce the weight of the privilege difference. We allow small companies to access a high quality software that is normally only accessible for the big corporations that can afford those kind of developments from scratch. And in this way, we help those small companies or companies from country "less" developed to compete with bigger and more powerful companies.*

*Let's use our privileged position to help the rest of the world to access those tools more easily. Let's give them more tools and more powerful. Let's contribute code. Let's spread the use of Free Software. Let's complain when we are forced to use a privative software when exist a free / libre alternative.*

![Drupal](/assets/images/posts/why-drupal/drupal.png)

*And that's the reason I use Drupal. And also the reason I use Apache, MySQL, PHP, Firefox, Linux, Vim, Elm, LibreOffice and so many more tools. That's the reason I always ask or look for a free / libre alternative before being forced to use a privative solution.*

*And for all of those reasons I want a more inclusive Drupal community, where there is room for any kind of person, even if they do not think like me. Because all this different people help me see the privileges I have and this knowledge, helps me fight to soften those differences on privilege.*

*And for all those reasons I want a community where there is no one who is above other member of the community. Where someone with more privilege can impose their decisions over people with less privileges.*
