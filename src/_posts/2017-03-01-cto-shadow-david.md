A few days ago I took part in an experience that is rather rare in most workplaces. I was invited to shadow Amitai, the CTO, and co-owner of Gizra, for a full day, in order to understand how things work from his perspective.

My impressions of this day are varied, but most importantly I understood things that I would not have learned if not going through this experience. In the end, I feel that I had one of the more interesting experiences and lessons a workplace can offer its employees. It didn't only enhance me professionally but also opened my mind on how to approach daily tasks.

Amitai was constantly explaining his thoughts and actions, to make it clear for me what was his line of thought.

The idea of allowing your employees to sit next to you, watch the day-to-day activities from the manager's chair, to encourage employees to review the manager, and then conduct a genuine and honest conversation and provide answers to difficult questions - are all indications of a real desire to improve, and create an open and accepting process with the employee.

Every type of feedback, so even Amitai can improve was accepted. In fact one of the special things for me in this experience is that even writing the negative feedback _publicly_ is encouraged.

## Managers do not know everything

On the first task I got to observe, we were supposed to write a price offer to a RFP. We needed to estimate the time and effort to the project and to give a price offer. The beautiful thing I saw during this quiet not simple process was the self-trust Amitai was showing in very unclear task - RFPs expect fixed price offers based on very little information.

Trusting your abilities isn't less important than knowledge. It what allows one to not easily give up and follow a gut feeling in pursuit of trying to do better.

## Articulate the problem

I realized how important it is to understand as much as possible when you get a task to perform.  
If we can get all the required information and to understand them in the early stage, we will prevent in advance the problems that might show up while we are working on something.

But knowing _when_ and _how_ to ask is also vital.

To minimize disruptions, it is important to come prepared with a precise and clearly formulated question. The answer to your question should ideally be binary. Something like "yes, you are in the right direction" or "No, because this and that". If the answer isn't one of these possibilities, you might have probably not went over properly over the task. Remember, "Managers do not know everything".

## How I feel today

After shadowing, we are requested to prepare a report. And possibly a blog post.

Using written words to describe my thoughts is definitely not placing me in my comfort zone. In fact, I feel that the pictures I have taken scattered in the post might be better reflecting what I'm trying to convey. However, having to do that forces me to go through a process which I feel contributes a lot to the way I look at things, here's on example:

One of the turning points I had in Gizra was when it was decided to change my role from a developer to a QA.

I remember I asked Amitai, "What do I need to do in order to succeed in this role?", and his response was "you should be excellent".

That was a horrible answer. It seemed to me like he was actually saying: "this is the position, good luck and bye!"

While I still hold my criticism about how that question was answered, I must admit that after the experience I understand that it actually meant what it said. That is, no matter what task you are given, truly try to be excellent.

## What my friends think of it

A couple of days after this experience, I met some of my friends and one of them asked me what's new at my workplace.

I shared with them what I've been through and I've noticed that all of them were hypnotized. It was completely puzzling for them - how could it be that I set with one of the company owners, and had to write a criticism about him. And not only was it accepted by him, but he actually encouraged me and guided me in writing this post.

The friend who asked the most questions is an owner of a business in the fashion industry in Israel and a few shops around the globe. she was amazed by this process, and immediately told me she is going to embrace this idea and start doing it at her business. I was so happy that I have succeeded to give the experience and to give inspiration to people regardless of their field of expertise.

I took all the pics at the building that Gizra Israel is located. If my words have not explained my ideas and thoughts, I hope the pictures have.
