A few days ago I took part in an experience that is rather rare in most workplaces. I was invited to shadow Amitai, the CTO, and co-owner of Gizra, for a full day, in order to understand how things work from his perspective.

My impressions of this day are varied, but most importantly I understood things that I would not have learned if not going through this experience. In the end, I feel that I had one of the more interesting experiences and lessons a workplace can offer its employees. It didn't only enhance me professionally but also opened my mind on how to approach daily tasks.

Amitai was constantly explaining his thoughts and actions, to make it clear for me what was his line of thought.

The idea of allowing your employees to sit next to you, watch the day-to-day activities from the manager's chair, to encourage employees to review the manager, and then conduct a genuine and honest conversation and provide answers to difficult questions - are all indications of a real desire to improve, and create an open and accepting process with the employee.

Every type of feedback, so even Amitai can improve was accepted. In fact one of the special things for me in this experience is that even writing the negative feedback _publicly_ is encouraged.

## Managers do not know everything

On the first task I got to observe, we were supposed to write a price offer to a RFP. We needed to estimate the time and effort to the project and to give a price offer. The beautiful thing I saw during this quiet not simple process was the self-trust Amitai was showing in very unclear task - RFPs expect fixed price offers based on very little information.

Trusting your abilities isn't less important than knowledge. It what allows one to not easily give up and follow a gut feeling in pursuit of trying to do better.

## Articulate the problem

I realized how important it is to understand as much as possible when you get a task to perform.  
If we can get all the required information and to understand them in the early stage, we will prevent in advance the problems that might show up while we are working on something.

But knowing _when_ and _how_ to ask is also vital.

To minimize disruptions, it is important to come prepared with a precise and clearly formulated question. The answer to your question should ideally be binary. Something like "yes, you are in the right direction" or "No, because this and that". If the answer isn't one of these possibilities, you might have probably not went over properly over the task. Remember, "Managers do not know everything".

## How I have developed as an employee

The request to express myself with the tools that I feel they are not my home court - to write the post, dealing with the needs to write a review, coping and thinking what to write and what not worthy, all this made me deal with something that probably I would not get there if I was not going through this process. I realized that I could say everything, whatever I think would be helpful for the individual and collective level.

One of the turning points I had in Gizra was the moment the management decided to change my role from developer to a QA.
My criticism about all the process started when I asked Amitai, "What I need to do to success in this role?", his response was “you should be excellent”.
I felt a little strange, it seemed to me like the success of this position isn’t really important to the company, something along the lines of: “this is the position, be excellent, good luck, bye!”
A solitude against this mega big thing to deal with, in addition, the fact that I do not get a guiding hand, made me feel a bit confused.
Just want to say that I was not coming from a place of stress or helplessness, I just need help in propulsion of large and complex process.

## How I feel today

Today, After the process I went through I feel I can produce a lot from the transformation to this role.
Furthermore this is another field I can learn from, it will allow me to deal with new situations that might come along.
I know that I need to go through the whole process from the beginning to the end of it,
But also I know that I won't be able to do this by own, I need a professional guidance, at least at the beginning in order to start the process.
Every single person has its own way and his own progress to pass through.

## What my friends think of it

A couple of days after the experience with Amitai, I met some of my friends and one of them asked me what's new at my workplace.
I shared all of them with what i've been through during that day and I've noticed that all of them were hypnotized and things weren't very clear to them - like, how could it be that I set with my CEO, and had to write a criticism about him that was accepted by him, and also created a dialogue between two people with no barriers.
The friend who asked the most questions is the owner of a business in the fashion industry here in Israel and a few shops around the globe. she was amazed by this process, and immediately informed she has to embrace this idea and start doing it at her business. I was so happy that I have succeeded to give the experience and to give inspiration to people that know nothing about our field.

I took all the pics at the building that Gizra is located.
The photos tries to combine with my inner feeling about the daily routine as an employee at Gizra.
