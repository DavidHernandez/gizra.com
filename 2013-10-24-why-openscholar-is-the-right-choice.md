## What is Harvard's OpenScholar?

[OpenScholar](http://openscholar.harvard.edu/) is Harvard's solution for providing a mini-site for each scholar, professur, and department. It can be a tiny site showing only the very little information, or a big ones like the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/). No coding required.
I won't go over all the features, trust me, there's a lot of costumization that can be done there. What I do want to talk about it, after being approached by several universities, is the subject of deciding if OpenScholar is the right choice for you, based on the _right_ reasons.
