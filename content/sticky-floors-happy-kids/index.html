          <p>There&#39;s a saying &quot;Good moms have sticky floors, messy kitchens, laundry piles, dirty ovens, and happy kids”. God knows I score an A+ and by that phrase alone I am THE perfect mother. But how do you leave those happy kids and get back to work?!</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/happy-kids/wonder-woman.jpg">
</div>

<p>I have 3 kids (recent one is brand new - in fact I&#39;m writing this post while being on maternity leave), which I absolutely adore and admire with every breath they take, a husband that I&#39;m (still, after so many years together) crazy about and, lucky me, I love my job and co-workers. </p>

<p>I must be the fortunate one to hit the jackpot as a most people I know are not even satisfied with one thing, let alone three!  </p>

<p>I should know. I was &quot;most people”. A nine to five office monkey, working tons of overtime and weekends, trying to get to the top. I was carefree at that time (for the singles in the crowd: this means no children) and my main concerns were questions such as what&#39;s the best party to attend to on Thursday night? Which movie to go to on Friday night? What to eat, where? You get my point.</p>

<p>So I met my husband; then came the kids; and then there was Gizra.</p>

<p>Gizra is known for our up-front, straightforward attitude, and as such I want to be very honest - on the verge of blunt - and share with you some thoughts.
I am a working mother. A wife. A person. Not by that specific order but that sounds just about right to me as I feel like the &quot;person&quot; part kicks in only after the kids are in beds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asking myself some questions lately:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to be at the office while I am on my maternity leave. Does that make me a bad mother?</li>
<li>I miss my kids and my husband and I want to be with them instead of being at the office, while I am at work. Does that make me a bad employee?</li>
<li>Sometimes I cannot stand the sound of my own name when one of my employees calls me, wants something from me. Does that make me a bad manager?</li>
<li>I find myself often screening my friends calls and avoiding meeting them (sometimes it involves telling a little white lie) because I just wanna stay home. Does that make me a bad friend?</li>
<li>Sometimes all I want is just be left alone for a while. No kids shouting M-O-M-M-Y, No employees telling me they need something from me. Does that make me a bad person?</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a way to keep everyone happy? Your kids, your bosses, your employees, your friends, your husband, and last but not least - even yourself?<br>
I just know I love my job; love my husband; love my kids (definitely not in that specific order).</p>

<p>Truth be told, I don&#39;t have all the answers, far from it, but I&#39;d like to share some tips on how you can make family and work combine (just a little bit) better together:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Working nine to five?</code> - Not necessarily! Try to be flexible in terms of working hours. You are killing two birds with one stone: arriving early means you get to leave early - just in time to get your kids out of daycare.</li>
<li><code>Safety net</code> - There&#39;s nothing like family support, if you&#39;re fortunate enough to have one who is able to help you. Play nice with your mother in law, your brother, your distant cousin etc.</li>
<li><code>Don&#39;t be a stranger</code> - There&#39;s a saying &quot;Better a nearby neighbor than a far away brother&quot;. Get to know your neighbors just a little bit better, you might find it useful one day.</li>
<li><code>Don&#39;t be sociopaths</code> - Everybody knows that the worst thing in the world is to be in a kindergarten&#39;s WhatsApp group! I&#39;d be the first to admit it - once I&#39;ve been added to one, I curse like hell and immediately silence it for a year! Who wants to get messages announcing the appearance of lice or which kid lost his coat or a toy. However, it may save your ass if you&#39;re stuck in traffic or in an important meeting and you might need another mom or dad to take your kids out of the kindergarten/school.</li>
<li>Playdates - Try to convince your kids to go to a playdate, preferably at another mom&#39;s house! That way you have some peace and quiet to finish some tasks you were suppose to finish long time ago or to finish an important presentation.</li>
</ul>
