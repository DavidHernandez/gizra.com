              <p><a href="http://www.nicklewis.org/40-essential-drupal-6-modules">Nick Lewis</a> wrote about his 40+ essential modules, and I really missed two modules there - Rules and Flag.
I commented that
<blockquote>
My top 5 are: Views, CCK, Flag, Rules, Panels. I think that the Flag &amp; Rules combo is less known in the community, but there are so many use cases they can cover. Because they are a bit abstracted it&#39;s hard for newbies to realize their potential.
</blockquote></p>

<p>I think there&#39;s no better way to show my point, than a tutorial. Lazy people can even download the feature from <a href="http://www.gizra.com/sites/default/files/user_points_rules.tar_.gz">here</a>. This tutorial will be about having &quot;User points&quot; functionality without using the user points module. I&#39;m not saying that module is bad, but sometimes I need multiple user points per user. Also, re-using existing modules always feels me with great joy. GREAT joy! Also, thinking about Drupal 7 with fields API, suddenly _user points can become _any-fieldable-entity points...
The tutorial will cover the &quot;Rule sets&quot; concept in Rules module, which is also considered by many as a great mystery. Let&#39;s define our mission:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ol>
<li>Every time a user creates a story content type, one point is deducted</li>
<li>When no points are left, user should not be able to create more stories</li>
<li>Upon content profile creation, the user receives three points</li>
<li>Site admin should be able to "reset" the points of users back to three points</li>
</ol>

<p>If your eyes no longer see the above list as words, but as Drupal modules, then you probably think CCK, Content profile, Rules and Flag.
We will add a content profile to each user. That profile will have a CCK field that will hold the user points. When user points reach zero, a &quot;story editor&quot; role will be removed from the user - denying access to creating new story content.
For &quot;reseting&quot; the user points, we will use a flag on the user, that a site admin can click on.
First preparations:
<ol>
<li>Download and enable modules (is there still anybody not using Drush?)
<code>
drush dl cck content_profile rules flag-6.x-2.x-dev features ctools strongarm-6.x-2.0-beta3
drush en -y content number content_permissions content_profile rules rules_admin flag features php ctools strongarm
</code>
</li>
<li>Make the new &quot;Profile&quot; content type a user profile through <em>admin/content/node-type/profile &gt;&gt; Content Profile &gt;&gt; Use this content type as a content profile for users</li>
<li>Add a new Integer type field called _field</em>user<em>points to the profile content type</li>
<li>In _admin/user/roles add a new role called &quot;story editor&quot;.</li>
<li>We should carefully take care of the permissions. In _admin/user/permissions - allow &quot;authenticated user&quot; role to _view  field</em>user_points and _create profile content; and allow &quot;story editor&quot; role to _create story content</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Before we set up our logic using Rules Let&#39;s go over a bit about the concept of &quot;Rule sets&quot;.
You should think of a rule sets as an API function. That function gets arguments and processes them. It&#39;s up to an implementing module to use the API function properly. Like API functions rule sets are there in order to prevent duplication and to centralize actions. Let&#39;s make the idea clear by thinking about points 1 and 2 in our mission. We have here two rules - one will deduct points from the user&#39;s profile, and the other should remove the &quot;story editor&quot; role.</p>

<p>We could create two triggered rules both with the event &quot;After saving new content&quot;, and check in both rules that the content type is story. As you can see, there&#39;s a duplication in the event and in the conditions. If our logic will change and be more complex the duplication might increase.</p>

<p>So, for such a case we will use the rule sets. We&#39;ll define two arguments that are mandatory one is a node, in which we&#39;ll pass the content profile. The other is the user. If you are a developer then think of it as <em>function user</em>points<em>logic($profile</em>content, $account).</p>

<p>In this rule sets we will add our two rules without even bothering to check if the new created content is indeed &quot;story&quot;. For that we&#39;ll have a third rule, that will not be a rule inside a rule sets, but a triggered rule. This rule will be executed &quot;After saving new content&quot;, will check the condition of the content type is story, and then willload the user&#39;s profile content and invoke our rule sets.</p>

<p>In terms of code, think of it as calling <em>user</em>points<em>logic() from _hook</em>nodeapi() upon node insert. Now that the concept should be clear, let&#39;s see how we do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you enabled the "PHP filter" core module, as we'll need few lines of PHP</li>
<li>Add a new rule sets (_admin/rules/rule_sets) labeled "User points" with _content and _user arguments.</li>
<li>Add a new rule in the "User points" rule sets labeled "Deduct points on story creation" and add the action _Populate a field, select the field _field_user_points and continue</li>
<li>Under "Advanced: Specify the fields value with PHP code" enter the following code (without the ```<?php ?>``` delimiters):

```php
<?php
// Current user points.
$current_points = $profile_node->field_user_points[0]['value'];

// Remove one point.
return array(
  // Rules will make sure the content profile is saved
  // after all rules have finished executing.
  0 => array('value' => ($current_points - 1)),
);
?>
```
</li>
<li>Create the second rule in the rule sets labeled "Remove role when no user points left" with the condition _Field has value, and again select _field_user_points. In the field value enter 0</li>
<li>Add action _Remove user role and select "story editor" role</li>
<li>Points 1 and 2 in our mission are almost complete, we only need to call the rule sets when appropriate. Create a triggered rule (_admin/rules/trigger) labeled "Invoke user points" with the event _After saving new content (we don't want to deduct point when user is just updating an existing content). Add condition _Content has type to check it's a story. Add action _Load content profile and make sure the argument _User, whose profile should be loaded is set to _content's author - we do that as the _acting user might be an admin manually creating a new user. Second action is _User points which is our rule sets. Also here make sure you pass the correct arguments (i.e. _content profile for the content argument and _content's author for the user argument).</li>
</ol>

<p>The implementation of &quot;reset&quot; points and grant points on user registration is similar in concept to our previous mission. We create a rule sets labeled &quot;User points grant&quot; which will set the field value to 3 and grant &quot;story editor&quot; role. This rule sets will be called from two different triggered rules - once upon content profile creation, and second when a site admin will &quot;reset&quot; the user points. How will the site admin &quot;reset&quot;? Easily - we&#39;ll create a new user type flag called &quot;Reset user points&quot;, and in Rules create a triggered rule that is invoked on the event _A user has been flagged, under &quot;Reset user points&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. Download the <A href="http://www.gizra.com/sites/default/files/user_points_rules.tar_.gz">feature</a>, and add your own logic.</p>
