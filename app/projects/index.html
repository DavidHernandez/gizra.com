                  OpenScholar is a full-featured solution for university systems, powering thousands
                  of Harvard University websites. Its strength is in its ability to allow departments, faculty, students, and
                  projects to spin up websites with the click of a button, and with enforceable standards,
                  look and feel, and sensible defaults.

                  Gizra is an integral part of the core development team for OpenScholar stemming from our
                  intimate knowledge of the Drupal-contributed Organic Groups module on top of which OpenScholar
                  is built. In addition, Gizra developed the entire automatic test suite, which is now the
                  largest of any Drupal distributions.

                  The European Commission selected Gizra to create a project management tool to manage
                  billions of Euros invested in developing world projects. Gizra helps define the tool
                  and is responsible for design, implementation, and deployment. The challenge was to
                  provide a simple and clean interface to vast amounts of data in a large multilingual
                  organization.

                  Our success led to the complementary Capacity4Dev project, where Gizra is in charge of
                  the UX, consulting, and development of its new version.

                <p>The National Library of Israel commissioned Gizra to create a virtual exhibition for
                  Madridâ€™s Casa del Lector museum. Visitors were given tablets to navigate the exhibition
                  content via an interactive map-like interface, providing access to video, audio, and
                  text-based media. The visitor could tap a node and instantaneously highlight its connections
                  within the network of content. A second tap took the user to the node content which
                  contained various options to interact with material. This sleek design and innovative
                  approach was a refreshing alternative to usual museum tours.

                  Gizra developed and implemented the new responsive design for The Hebrew University of
                  Jerusalem Admissions Department. Faced with the need to convey its well-established
                  brand, and speak to a multitude of potential applicants, the University sought Gizra
                  for a solution. Together, we transformed the existing traditional site into a
                  user-friendly, but content-rich, fully-accessible interface, geared to the demanding
                  needs of its user community.

                  Birthright Israel, the largest Jewish Educational project in the world, needed to develop a

                  educators. Through this platform, the initiative trains 200 educators a year.

                  Gizra helped to develop a streamlined user experience that allowed applicants to learn

                  participants in key concepts in experiential education and best practices in program 
                  planning for an educational experience in Israel. In addition, Gizra developed a resources 
                  exchange which allows fellows to document program design and share and reflect with other 
                  cohort members.

                  in Africa could be insured on the open market.
