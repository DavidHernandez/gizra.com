                  OpenScholar is a full-featured solution for university systems, powering thousands 
                  of Harvard University websites. Its strength is in its ability to allow departments, faculty, students, and 
                  projects to spin up websites with the click of a button, and with enforceable standards, 
                  look and feel, and sensible defaults.

                  Gizra is an integral part of the core development team for OpenScholar stemming from our 
                  intimate knowledge of the Drupal-contributed Organic Groups module on top of which OpenScholar 
                  is built. In addition, Gizra developed the entire automatic test suite, which is now the 
                  largest of any Drupal distributions.

                  The European Commission selected Gizra to create a project management tool to manage 
                  billions of Euros invested in developing world projects. Gizra helps define the tool 
                  and is responsible for design, implementation, and deployment. The challenge was to 
                  provide a simple and clean interface to vast amounts of data in a large multilingual 
                  organization.

                  Our success led to the complementary Capacity4Dev project, where Gizra is in charge of 
                  the UX, consulting, and development of its new version.

                <p>The National Library of Israel commissioned Gizra to create a virtual exhibition for 
                  Madridâ€™s Casa del Lector museum. Visitors were given tablets to navigate the exhibition 
                  content via an interactive map-like interface, providing access to video, audio, and 
                  text-based media. The visitor could tap a node and instantaneously highlight its connections 
                  within the network of content. A second tap took the user to the node content which 
                  contained various options to interact with material. This sleek design and innovative 
                  approach was a refreshing alternative to usual museum tours.

                  Gizra presents a new approach in live online auction trade - exposing and positioning 
                  traditional Judaica objects and manuscripts, in this case, in an online platform 
                  especially developed to simplify the procedure of public auctions. Bidding is made 
                  easy and accessible at any time online, simplifying the process for both the seller 
                  and purchaser, thereby increasing the number of transactions.
