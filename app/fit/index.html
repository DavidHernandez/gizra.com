        <h3>If it's your first project, we may not be the right company for you.</h3>
        <p>
          It's not your first time implementing and maintaining a digital project. You have learned 
          that there are a range of possible outcomes and even though the projects launched, the end 
          result does not quite hit the mark. It's usually because it does not accomplish any one of 
          the following requirements of a successful project: on time, within budget, with happy users.
        </p> 
        <h3>There is another way.</h3>
        <p>
          If we fit, you will need a full blown company audit to determine your digital strategy… ok, not 
          really.  You probably require our pragmatic approach called “The Gizra Way”  - a set of best practices 
          and methodologies, borrowed from the Open Source development world and applied to operations, workflow, 
          and overall company culture.

          Projects can be on time, within budget and yes, even with happy users.

                At the discovery phase, we partner with you to clarify 
                your objectives and determine the best tools and way to get there.  At the end of the discovery 
                phase, you will have a clear vision and a detailed task and budget breakdown.  We can also step 
                into a project at different points of the journey, from start to finish or at a specific 
                point that requires some extra attention.

                Your organization is really good at what they do and 
                require the right technology strategy to support it.  Depending on your organization’s requirements, 
                this would occur with close partnership with your CTO or fill the position if required.

                price estimations - a real and perhaps radical example of how transparent communication from 
                the beginning about a project’s needs alongside its budget can turn the process on it’s head.
