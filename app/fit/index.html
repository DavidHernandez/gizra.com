          In a web project, we believe that fit matters. If we fit, beautiful things happen.

        <h3>You’ve been down this road before.</h3>
        <p>
          You have learned that there are a range of possible outcomes, and even though the project 
          launched, the end result didn’t quite hit the mark. It's probably because it did not 
          accomplish one of the following requirements: 1. it was on time, 2, it was within budget, 
          3. the users were happy.
        </p> 
        <h3>There is another way.</h3>
        <p>
          Why would you compromise? You don’t need to accept that project work is imperfect, that cost 
          and time overruns are inevitable, and that your users can’t be totally happy  Our approach
           -- called “The Gizra Way” --  cuts through the nonsense and uses simple, but radical tools 
           to bring you a successful project.
        </p>
        <p class="text-emphasis">
          Projects can be on time, within budget and yes, even with happy users.

                Whether you deliver a product or serve a cause, your company or organization exists for a purpose. We want 
                to understand that purpose to get to the core value that you want to create.

                Your project applies a solution to a need. Before we even really get started, we’ll help you articulate 
                and focus that solution so that we don’t waste valuable resources on things you don’t need.

              <p class="list-box__item__text text-small">
                With budget goggles, we make a mindful effort to clearly breakdown your project into time-boxed 
                tasks (no larger than 12 hours) - each with a clear deadline and cost to produce the deliverable. 
                Our budget breakdown creates a common language between us and sets expectations early on.

               “Are we a good fit for each other?” sounds like a dating request and in many ways, what we are doing 
               here is similar. We take an active approach and lead you through the process, as someone you can count 
               on.
