It all started when I came across the Gizra calendar and saw an ongoing events with the title: Scrum.
I did not know the word, and in spite I wasn't invited to these meetings, when I come across something unfamiliar, curiosity is killing me. 
So I opened Google Translate but the result I got did not make sense:

Google Translate known as not precise and sometimes translates words in a funny way, but it was too much.
I thought to myself, what the hell is going on in the meeting room???

Well, because I didn't hear strange noises from the room, and didn't see anybody walking around dressed like rugby player, I realized that I was probably missing something.
So I asked the father of Google Translate: Google itself. Then the picture has become much more relaxing. Actually, it has become a fascinating!
I found myself rolling from one article to another, reading about the Scrum method and enthusiastic about the idea. Luckily I try to stick to the Time Boxing method of time management, so at some point I had to stop, otherwise it could devouring my all day. 
The exposure to the Scrum method led me to think about my role as a trainer in Gizra. After all, if I work in company who has adopted a work method based on the concept of Agile, the training also need to support in this method.

When I started to work at Gizra three months ago, I got the title: Employee training & development. Except that this title was very excited for me  (I excited from anything that has the word 'training'), I do not really know what I should do with it. Fortunately, Amitai also not entirely knew. Great, there's nothing more exciting from לחרוש קרקע בתולה
I do not know many companies with 20+ employees who have decided to invest full time job in the role of employee training. Frankly, I do not know any such company.
It says something very important for me about Gizra - they wants to invest in their best employees and make them even better.
But how to get there? This is a question that I still do not have a full answer for it.
So in the meantime I will share with you just a thoughts.
