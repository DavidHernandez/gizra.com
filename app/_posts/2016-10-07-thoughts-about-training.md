{% include setup %}

It all started when I came across an ongoing Gizra calendar event with the title 'Scrum'.
I didn't know the word and I wasn't invited to these meetings. But when I come across something unfamiliar, my curiosity took over.
So I used Google Translate, but the result I got did not make sense:

Google Translate known as not precise and sometimes translates words in a funny way, but it was too much.
I thought to myself, what the hell is going on in the meeting room???

{% include thumbnail.html image_path="assets/images/posts/thoughts-about-training/rugby_scrum.jpg" %}

Well, because I didn't hear strange noises from the room, and didn't see anybody walking around dressed like rugby player, I realized that I was probably missing something.
So I asked the father of Google Translate: Google itself. Then the picture has become much more relaxing. Actually, it has become a fascinating!
I found myself rolling from one article to another, reading about the Scrum method and enthusiastic about the idea. 

When I started to work at Gizra three months ago, I got the title: Employee training & development. Except that this title was very excited for me  (I excited from anything that has the word 'training'), I do not really know what I should do with it. The exposure to the Scrum method led me to rethink about my role in Gizra.

Scrum base on the Agile methodology, which is a lighter weight approach to software development than many of the traditional approaches. Scrum, unlike other traditional methods, built on the premise that it is impossible to think in advance about all the possible scenarios. In a dynamic world, especially when it comes to software development, changes occur all the time: The clients come with new demands, according to the changes in the market and born of new technologies.
The more I read about Scrum I realized that not just the development process needs to be agile, also the training process should take into consideration these changes. What we teach today, will not necessarily appropriate to what the employees need to know tomorrow, so the training program should be built that it would be flexible to changes and new requirements.

I do not know many companies with 20+ employees who have decided to invest full time job in the role of employee training. Frankly, I do not know any such company.
It says something very important for me about Gizra - they wants to invest in their best employees and make them even better.
But how to get there? This is a question that I still do not have a full answer for it.
So in the meantime I will share with you just a thoughts.


##Teach them swim or throw them to the water?
Are employees need to get organized training, includes the study of all the swimming movements, or perhaps to just show them the pool and let them reveal themselves?
In other words: Who is responsible for Learning, the worker or the guide?

When I came to Gizra, they threw me into the water. The water in Gizra is very deep! It was a very frustrating experience. I know how to swim and I did all the moves I know, and yet I felt a lot of times I'm drowning. It was a new pool, different water temperature, and it tooks time before I learned how to take a rest in the shallow water and where is the ladder to exit the pool. To say the truth, I'm still learning.
For a new employee, it is a very inconvenient experience, even stressful, and I admit that sometimes raised in my head go back to my previous work, familiar and cozy, where I knew how to swim well.
What kept me going is the very early understanding of "The Gizra Way": You are allowed to make a mistake here. The message was clear: the important thing is to keep doing, make mistakes and do better next time. I realized that nobody would fire me because I was wrong, as long as I noticed my mistakes, learn from them and make all efforts not to be wrong in the same place twice.

Organized training advantage is that it facilitates the entry process which is not an easy as it is. It prevents unnecessary frustrations and allows more rapid learning. From the first moment the person understand what is expected from him, the knowledge is gradually built, and he makes less mistakes. I believe that eventually it significantly shortens the "newbie" time.
On the other hand this process can make passive workers, they just needs to come to class and they will get all the answers.

When someone thrown into the water he must be active. Study the movements on his own. The message is that you have responsibility for your learning. There is a value for questioning and self-discovery, and it encourages initiative and a "ראש גדול". I think that when a person finally figure out something on his own, he gets greater satisfaction.

In the web development world, quickly and constantly changing, this is a very important skill to learn alone. But of course all this should take place in an environment demands excellence on the one hand, but on the other hand let you go wrong and learn from mistakes. I found this atmosphere at Gizra and we need to preserve it.

However, I am still trying to find the right formula that would combine structured learning and independent study.
What issues important to teach the class?
What should leave for self-study?
How to encourage curiosity to learn on your own?
How to create a safe and comfortable atmosphere to study alone? 
How to make frustration become motivation and not despair?

And what about the company goods (טובת החברה)? What is the fastest way to train an employee? How much אורך נשימה the company has to absorb mistakes?

##Google is man's and woman’s best friend
Over a learning process, it is very important to convey the message that should not be afraid to say: I do not know. No one expects you to know everything, especially when you are a newbie. To be honest, in this point when I write these words and still a newbie myself at Gizra, I feel that there are more things I do not know than things I know. 
On the other hand, do not give yourself. Un-Knowing should motivate you to act! Have you heard any idea that you do not understand? Met in Unknown tool that not clear to you what it is doing? Google it! Ask and not loosen it until you know.
Good employees are employees who know their job.
Excellent employees are employees who know what they do not know, and continue learning.

##Who knows better, the teacher or the student?
The basic premise we have become accustomed to is that the specialists should teach. Big companies that have organized training department, tend to experts (external or internal) to provide training on topics in which they specialize.
But what about small companies that have a smaller number of employees and limited resources?

Gizra is technology-intensive work environment, that constantly added new tools. People come from all kinds of backgrounds and with different levels of knowledge on various topics. Therefore, it is clear that there are more than a few issues that employees know better than me, the trainer.
This point bothered me greatly - at first I thought I should take all the responsibility on the knowledge, the trainer has to know everything about what she have to teach. I quickly realized that even though I really want to, I can not know everything. So what is most important is that what I do know, I can teach better.
If so, it is important that I have a good training skills, but how to succeed in bridging the knowledge gaps?

Once, when I was in Education field, before I entered the web development world, I worked in a wonderful place called The Secular Yeshiva. This is a place where secular people learn and take responsibility for setting their Jewish identity.
One method, שהשאירה בי חותם, was the ancient Jewish method: Hevruta (learning with partners).
Hevruta is learning in small groups (3-5 people), and the idea is that the group is an arena where no one has authority over knowledge. Learning occurs during the exchange of ideas and knowledge sharing among participants.

Well, if knowledge is also in the workers heads, let's get it out from there and share it with everyone.
In pedagogical world it's called Peer learning. In other words, students teaching each other. In this way people are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, the message is that everyone has a responsibility for learning and we also learn and teach. It's a start of creating a culture of contribution and sharing of knowledge.
How to implement this? Well, I am still think about it, promising to update in the next post.

##What to teach?
Trainings on technology? Training on skills and practices?
Where to start? There is so much to learn and who should know what?
One of the principles of Scrum is that everyone needs to know everything! This way everyone can perform any task (Characterizing the structure, testing, Front end, Back end, etc.), So if there is a strain on one team, another team can help him.
In addition, project managers, marketers and even customers need to understand the development work, to create a common language in order that communication will be much more effective and clear.

Therefore, we need to find a way to create מערך שיעור that work for everyone.  We should take into consideration that developers come with different world Concepts (עולם מושגים) from project managers come with, and therefore training needs to be adjusted. For example, when talking about [How to approach a new task](https://www.thegizraway.com/approach_data_structure_task.html), developers will be very clear with terms such as query and relationship, but they may have difficulty to explain it in literal language and go straight talking in programming language. Marketing and project managers rather easily understand the story, since most of their work is to understand the needs of customers, but may find it difficult to take apart the entities and identify the relationships between them.
If we want to create a common language for everyone, we need to understand these differences and consider them during training.


##What about Work Plan?
I am by nature a very planned person. I used to work with well defined goals and not release a product before it is complete. Therefore, my natural tendency was to start work on a training plan program, and only then begin to do training session to the employees.

Well, that didn't happen. In the second week of my work I found myself teaching subject that I learned only a few days earlier. It felt like they threw me into the water from a height Olympic springboard, it was so high I could hear myself screaming before I hit the water. 
I'm not used to be where I'm not an expert on what I'm going to talk about. I did it but not at all convinced that this was the right way.

But then I came across in Scrum and more I read האסימונים התחילו ליפול.
Unlike traditional method which has detailed documents defining goals and objectives, Scrum has concise lists (backlog) and a lot of practice face to face with all the people involved. In addition, there is an emphasis on achieving efficacy: How useful things we created in a given period?

If I was sticking to my familiar method, it is likely the first two months I was only builds training programs, learning content, prepare lessons and only then start teaching.
In practice, today, only three months in my new job, I already teach 15 classes in 5 different topics. At this rate (בקצב הזה) excites me to know where we will be in a year from now…

Is the first training sessions was good? No, of course they could be much better if I had more time to study the matter and prepare. But going back to the Scrum model, they were the best training version I could release at that time. I knew I had enough trainings along the way, so I could continue to improve while movinig.
If I did not jump into the water so early, it may be that only now I had the first training session. So maybe I was more confident standing in front of the class, but we were moving forward much slowly. Maybe even this post couldn’t be written because I wouldn't understand a lot of things I understand now.

Still hard to shake off old patterns and even when I am writing these lines I find it difficult to release and say, this is good enough version of the post. I still have a lot of open questions, and I still could not fully answer the question: how to set up a training program in a small company.
But I remind myself to think "scrumy" and say: Let Go, even in Rugby they don't stay with their arms interlocked all the time.
