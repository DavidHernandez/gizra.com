Most of the software development work is to solve problems. For some time I was trying to work out whether there is a formula, strategy, something that can be taught - how to solve a problem? I cleared my day and for a few hours I became a shadow of Amitai, Gizra’s CTO, hoping to learn something from it. It was fascinating!

Most of the time Amitai was busy writing code in Elm.
I (still) do not know Elm and so I understood very little of the code written, but the truth is it doesn’t matter at all, because I learned a lot just by looking at his way of working. And because what I love most is to teach others what I have learned on my own, here is what I have learned from watching:

##Without Shortcuts
Work orderly, make small steps but correct one, focus on one thing and not jump from one place to another. If you must leave an open edge in a certain place, record it so you can easily go back there later.  Write organized code with clear hierarchies, use clear names for variables and functions. Do not be stingy with comments to explain what the code is doing.

##Recording
Write in GitHub every step you are doing, even if you are the only one working on this project, and no one else going to read it. The documentation forcing you to constantly be aware of your steps, and if you get lost, you can always go back and check what you already have been tried and what you didn’t yet try.  
Write so that everyone else understands what you wrote - I saw Amitai doing code review  and how hard it is to go inside another developer mind. Be kind, explain clearly what you did, attach screenshots when you submit Pull Request - it makes others life so much easier.

##Don’t believe yourself
Even though you know you are a good developer, you can’t trust yourself without checking your work. Check your code again and again, to see in your eyes that the code is doing what you expected. Do it in small pieces, so it will be easier to identify where the problem if the code does not work.

##Don’t panic / get discouraged when things do not work
Problems are part of the road and need to believe all the time that you can solve them. I heard  Amitai said it many times during his struggling with the code: “We will be there soon”, “Believe me we reach the end ... ". It's a big difference from saying to yourself: “Oh, this is not going well, this is too difficult for me” or “I'm not good enough for this”.  
I admit there was a moment I thought: maybe he needs ask someone instead of breaking his head. But the fact he didn’t even mentioned this option, and it was clear that he is going to deal with it, no matter what, was very impressed. Guess what? In the end, he succeeded solving the problem.

##Dare to start over again
We want to be good. The best we can be.  
You worked hard, invested time and thought, but you're not happy with what came out? Do you think you could do it better? Do not be afraid to throw everything and start over.  
Many times you do not know how to approach the problem, and sometimes you just need to start walking. Then, you could find that you have chosen the wrong path. In that case you have to be brave to admit it, and bold to choose a new path.  
This is exactly what needs to be done - without looking back, without regret the time spent, without getting stuck the previous path just because you have already started to go there. Always keep an open mind, be willing to try and make a mistake, this is the best way to learn and grow. That is what success made of.

##Be glad to get comments, it's free!
No one likes to get bad comments, and it may be frustrating to get them for every little thing, but I think it is necessary. This is something that you should not be compromise on, if we want to be the best. This is a wonderful opportunity to get better and I think people have to be thankful that someone review their code carefully and remarks it.  
Actually, When I watched Amitai, I noticed that he writes detailed and accurate comments (which I very appreciate) but on the other hand, his compliments are general and contain one or two word or even just an icon. I turned his attention to this, because I think that when someone is doing something good, he needs to hear a good word. It’s nice and it gives you feeling of valued for the effort you made. No need to save good words when they are appropriate.  
So here where Amitai had the chance to improve himself.  
As I say, comments are a gift you should take with both hands! But you also should enjoy the compliments. Did you get a good comment, appreciate your work? Read it at least twice, it's satisfied and you earned it!

To summarize, I think it inspires and teaches to watch another person work (for me it also satisfies curiosity and voyeurism). I highly recommend to anyone to do it at least once.  
Chose a good developer, ask to be his shadow for a few hours, come curious, ask him to verbalize what he is doing, take a good look, pay attention to detail, ask questions, you can also write notes to yourself. I promise - you will learn a lot!
