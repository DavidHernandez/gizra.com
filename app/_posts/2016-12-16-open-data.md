The way I learned what open source actually means was not the standard way, I guess. It started when I got involved in “[The Public Knowledge Workshop](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en),” an NGO of Israeli activists, devoting their leisure time to making public data free and accessible.

The founding story of this volunteer community impressed me -- and even  more so, given their social and political impact they have had. It began with a university student wondering [who he should vote for in the coming elections](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/The-info-is-there-but-who-can-figure-it-out-349934). He sent a request for data and statistics to The Knesset (the Israeli parliament) spokesperson and received a standard reply with reference to the official website. Back then, the website [consisted of mainly static protocols](https://web.archive.org/web/20041214013530/http://knesset.gov.il/main/heb/home.asp). It meant that hey had to devote months to skim and read hundreds of pages to answer each of the questions he was curious about. That’s when the story becomes interesting: he started to write scripts to answer the questions to speed up the process so he could get it by election time.  Like every good open source story, he found that many others had the same “itch”. 

They created the [Open Knesset website](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/projects/open-knesset/), which became the leading instrument for gathering updated and archival information about the Knesset. The site never intended to replace, nor compete, with the official website. The purpose was to exemplify required properties and usability of the data in the parliament website.

I could add here more great stories like these, because there are plenty of them all around the globe. You can find more by choosing a field of interest at the [opengovguide report generator](http://www.opengovguide.com/report-builder/). Those stories teach of the essence of public open data: the effort to redesign relationships between citizens and governments, in era where reproducing the raw material of decisions costs as much as (…or less than) a [rubber duck](http://www.ebay.com/sch/items/?_nkw=rubber+ducks&_sacat=&_ex_kw=&_mPrRngCbx=1&_udlo=&_udhi=&_sop=12&_fpos=&_fspt=1&_sadis=&LH_CAds=&rmvSB=true).

I believe that open source developers should get involved and take part in efforts like these for two main reasons. First, I believe that dealing with open data challenges make you a better developer. They tend to improve critical and creative thinking and force us to focus on the end users and [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Secondly, it is a great way to utilize your professional skills for [a better society](http://ideas.ted.com/how-open-government-data-creates-smarter-societies). Yes, descent data is crucial, even if you believe we just entered “[the post truth era](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016)”.

##From data to public open data 

When thinking of public data, just like with any code, you should ask yourself “how do I want it to be served”:

Following this visual metaphor, the main question is whether we expect the data producer/collector serve it as a solid manufactured product, or should the client (or user) have the right (and ability) to reshape and reuse it. Another way to put it is who actually owns the data, and does he/she has the right to limit the usage of the data. Interestingly, the civic society organizations were those who set some pragmatic [definitions of governmental open data](https://opengovdata.org/), that were adopted and recognized later by state organizations:

1. Complete (Bring it all, not just a part or parts of it).
2. Primary (Publicize it as it was collected, granular as possible).
3. Timely (give it ASAP, since time influences the data’s usability and value).
4. Accessible (consider the means of distribution to enable as  many as possible to use the data).
5. Machine Processable (…make it usable, not only readable).
6. Non-discriminatory (Make it available to all, without any demand to register).
7. Non-proprietary (Neither the content nor the format should be limiting users).
8. License-free (except for some reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions. These words might make you yawn, but actually it is  one of the most tumultuous arenas of struggles.)

These are the original parts of the open data definition, but of course, like any other open source project, they are [dynamic](http://opendefinition.org/participate/), [forked](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/), and have [evolved](http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/).

##Got it, how can I start?

- Check out what is happening in your country, region, municipality, or in any other place of interest. The [World Wide Web Foundation’s Barometer](http://opendatabarometer.org/) or the [Open Knowledge’s Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/)) are beneficial resources.
- Search relevant open source code repositories, and look for open issues that fit your development skill.
- Resist the temptation to start by building your own project - most likely someone already thought about a solution for the problem you face. [Check it out](http://www.opengovguide.com/report-builder/) and consider joining those efforts. [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org/) can help you to connect with active groups in your region.
- Embrace the opportunity to learn and to gain experience. Don’t expect quick results.
