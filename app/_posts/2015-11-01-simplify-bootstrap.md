Twitter Bootstrap framework and hopefully help you to simplify your workflow and
make it more intuitive.

## The traditional approach
Bootstrap provides us with a powerful responsive layout and a matching grid system
but with **great power comes great responsibility!**. The responsibility of making
sure that our website/app behavior is consist across all breakpoints and that the
layout isn't broken as well isn't always an easy task to achieve and above
all it consume a considerable amount of project time.

The vast majority of our project at Gizra are based upon Bootstrap
and we often spend a lot of time and effort on creating the perfect layout
across all breakpoints.

## How can we simplify it ?
The first thing we need to to before starting to work on the project is to
understand it's responsive pattern. We can do that by exploring the project
requirements and needs:

 * How big is the project ?
   * how many pages/views/features/widgets you have ?
 * Is this project suitable to be a hybrid website/app ?
