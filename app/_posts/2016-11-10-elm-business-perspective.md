Elm, like any rising open source project is getting critiques from both sides. Reading the good ones, are always fun, but the negative ones are just as important.

I came across today this [Elm Is Wrong](http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/elm-is-wrong), and realized that I've always read the good and bad critiques from a technological point of view. I have yet to read about what it means from a business owner perspective.

I can assure you it's a different perspective. One that is about dollars and cost of bugs. Not about "type classes" or "higher kinded types".

Being the CTO of Gizra means I'm always for the lookout on how we can improve our process and stack. I believe the unique stack we currently have (Drupal, Yesod and Elm) is a natural outcome of the mindset we have.

Being the co-owner of Gizra, is probably the best way to assure that I'm very mindful to our technological choices. Can they actually make us more productive, and as a result allow us to gain more money. As simple as that.

## Correctness

Elm fits very nicely into this mindset. In fact, it is thanks to being exposed to functional programin, which Elm makes so approachable, I'm able now to articulate that in Gizra we really care about correctness. But we care about it, not from the marketing point of view of saying "we care about quality, because we are awesome", but rather form the accounting point of view saying "we care about quality, because we cannot charge for fixing our own bugs".
