# [planet.elm-lang.org](http://planet.elm-lang.org/) is live!

Nice, right? Planet Elm and its [RSS feed](http://planet.elm-lang.org/feeds.xml) is up and running - just grab it, and the best Elm related posts would appear in your favorite RSS reader.

Having this main site as a central place for aggregating all the interesting content about Elm, is yet another step in getting Elm into the mainstream. If you have posts about this, go ahead, and [submit your RSS feeds](https://github.com/Gizra/planet-elm/wiki/Planet-Elm-guidelines).

## Déjà Vu

I'd like to share some of my thoughts about Elm, through a prism I'm looking at it - my Drupal experience. Gizra has been a _long_ time with Drupal. How long? Enough for us to fall in love with some parts of it (read as the community), and hate some others (read as nasty parts of the code base. You know, like every project).  
In other words, we're about 10 years with it.

But please, even though the next section might have the word Drupal in it, and you are that cool RPF developer - keep reading and stop thumbing your nose! :)

## Past Experience


<!-- more -->


Community is the biggest asset, not the code. Why do I think Elm is also believing in it? Because everybody is so freaking nice and supportive. No nasty remarks, no "This is not working, fix it as if you owe me something" comments, no RTFM answers.

Elm is for pragmatic<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>*</sup></a> devs and not purists. You know, a bit like Drupal and PHP. I know, I know, PHP is one of those languages people love to hate. In one of every ten discussions in Elm's mailing list you could probably find a snarky remark on PHP. It's fair. PHP definitely deserves a lot of the critic - I've seen a lot of code written in poor taste. But in the end PHP doesn't try to be beautiful. It's about getting things done. It now up to us as the community, to show things can be done it with.


Elm is _now_ the new kid on the block. But believe it or not, us Drupal devs we used to be cool back in the days (I think we still are, but I guess that's debatable). Being in the mainstream means stuff will be changing. Bigger market, bigger money, bigger community. And bigger expectations.

Jerks and trolls will be added along the way. I saw it as Drupal became more wide spread. Knowing that in advance will keep the surprise element out and allow us to better manage the community and the challenges of a bit community.

A few high profile developers will suffer from burn out. As community gets bigger, finding the life/ work/ contribution balance gets hard. Knowing that in advance and helping people with this aspect is invaluable. Dealing with burn out and even with [mental health](https://youtu.be/TdEVaOjL20s) has been a big issue in the Drupal community - such community maturity and openness should be learned from.



I started with the community I'd like to close with the code. Apart of the high code quality. Apart of the generally experienced web developers. Apart of the all goodies the compiler puts on the table. Elm is trying, and in my opinion succeeding, to be a real tool to solve real problems.

Elm still has a lot of work to do in order to be mainstream. But from the place I'm standing from, and from my angle - it's doing a lot of things right. And the things it's doing wrong - Well, it's up to us as the community, and each one with their experience, to help navigate this promising open source project.
