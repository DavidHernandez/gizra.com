Having this main site as a central place for aggregating all the interesting content about Elm, is yet another step in getting Elm into the mainstream.

For me, this move feels somewhat familiar. Gizra, my company, (and me) have been long time with Drupal. How long? Enough for me to fall in love with some parts of it (read as the community), and hate some others (read as some nasty part of the code. You know, like every project).

I'd like to share some of my early thoughts about Elm, through this prism I'm looking at it - my Drupal experience. And even though it has the word Drupal and you are the coolest RPF developer, please keep reading and stop thumbing your nose! :)

## What I Learned From Drupal

PHP, is one of those languages people love to hate. In one of every ten discussions in Elm's mailing list you could probably find a snarky remark on PHP. It's fair. PHP definitely deserves a lot of the critic, as well as a lot of the praises.

Here are some of the points where I see the resemblance Elm and Drupal. I believe the word Drupal, could have been replaced with other projects, but you know, I'm sharing _my_ experience here:


<!-- more -->

* Elm is _now_ the new kid on the block. But believe it or not, us Drupal devs we used to be cool back in the days (I think we still are, but I guess that's debatable). Being in the mainstream means stuff will be changing. Bigger market, bigger money, bigger community. And bigger expectations.
* Realization that community is the biggest asset, not the code. How do I know Elm is also believing in it? Because everybody is so freaking nice and supportive. No nasty comments, or "This is not working, fix it as if you owe me something" comments.
* Jerks will be added along the way. I saw it as Drupal became more wide spread. Knowing that in advance will keep the surprise out and allow us to better manage the community.
* Being pragmatic and not purists. While Elm started as a thesis, it aims to be a real tool to solve real problems.
* A few high profile developers will burn out. As community gets bigger, finding the life/ work/ contribution balance it's hard. Knowing that in advance and helping people with this aspect is invalubale. Dealing with burn out and even with [mental health](https://youtu.be/TdEVaOjL20s) has been a big issue in the Drupal community - such openness should not be underestimated.
