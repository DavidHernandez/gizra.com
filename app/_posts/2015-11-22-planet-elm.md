Nice, right? [planet.elm-lang.org](http://planet.elm-lang.org/) and its [RSS feed](http://planet.elm-lang.org/feeds.xml) is up and running - just grab it, and the best Elm related posts would appear in your favorite RSS reader.

Having this main site as a central place for aggregating all the interesting content about Elm, is yet another step in getting Elm into the mainstream.

For me, this move feels somewhat familiar. Gizra has been long time with Drupal. How long? Enough for us to fall in love with some parts of it (read as the community), and hate some others (read as some nasty part of the code. You know, like every project).

I'd like to share some of my early thoughts about Elm, through this prism I'm looking at it - my Drupal experience. And even though it has the word Drupal and you are the cool RPF developer, please keep reading and stop thumbing your nose! :)

## What I Learned From Drupal

PHP, is one of those languages people love to hate. In one of every ten discussions in Elm's mailing list you could probably find a snarky remark on PHP. It's fair. PHP definitely deserves a lot of the critic, as well as a lot of the praises.

Here are some of the points where I see the resemblance Elm and Drupal. I believe the word Drupal, could have been replaced with other projects, but you know, I'm sharing _my_ experience here:


<!-- more -->


* Community is the biggest asset, not the code. How do I know Elm is also believing in it? Because everybody is so freaking nice and supportive. No nasty remarks, no "This is not working, fix it as if you owe me something" comments, no RTFM answers.
* Elm is _now_ the new kid on the block. But believe it or not, us Drupal devs we used to be cool back in the days (I think we still are, but I guess that's debatable). Being in the mainstream means stuff will be changing. Bigger market, bigger money, bigger community. And bigger expectations.
* Jerks and trolls will be added along the way. I saw it as Drupal became more wide spread. Knowing that in advance will keep the surprise out and allow us to better manage the community.
* A few high profile developers will burn out. As community gets bigger, finding the life/ work/ contribution balance it's hard. Knowing that in advance and helping people with this aspect is invalubale. Dealing with burn out and even with [mental health](https://youtu.be/TdEVaOjL20s) has been a big issue in the Drupal community - such community maturity and openness should be learned from.
* Elm is for pragmatic devs and not purists. For me this is super important.

I started with the community I'd like to close with the code. Apart of the high code quality. Apart of the generally experienced web developers. Apart of the all goodies the compiler puts on the table. Elm is trying, and in my opinion succeeding, to be a real tool to solve real problems.
It still has work to do in order to be mainstream. But from the place I'm standing from, and from my angle - it's doing a lot of things right. And the things it's doing wrong. Well, it's up to us as the community, and each one with their experience, to help navigate this promising open source project.

* What it "being pragmatic" for me? Well, grab a drink, sit back, and watch this 30 minutes explanation called [The Gizra Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PezawfaFRKE).
