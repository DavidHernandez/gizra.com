Iv'e been at Hewlett Packard Enterprise HQ for meet up about [mean.js](http://meanjs.org/)
Bootstrap and although those technologies don't relate to us there was another
issue we talked about - contribution to open source projects.

While we waited for the arrival of איק pizza and ate a nice popsicle some one
asked me why we still working with Drupal? There a lot of technologies that
could help us more than Drupal. The talk was going well and there wasn't a
winner in this talk but I thought about the talk and I realized that a lot of
the Drupal community members face this questions more often than me.

I thought about it and came up with 8 reasons why Drupal is the tool we are
using on the daily base.

<!-- more -->
1. Content oriented - mean.js and other solutions can't provide the same exprience to create data structure and manage content.
2. Plugins, hooks, events, services - All above have awesome tools for developers which I don't think exists in such large scale on other frameworks
3. Commerce expreince - Tools as Commerce kickstart and all the libraries they create for symfony are awesome!
4. OG - You can't find it in any other framework. And I'm willing to put my macbook pro on this one
5. I18n
6. awesome community
7. Uncompromising QA for modules
8. Migration already come with Drupal 8 - easy to migrate OLD drupal sites.
