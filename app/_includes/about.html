        <p>
          Gizra has developed a unique work methodology called 
          <strong><a href="#gizra-way" class="smooth-scroll-to">The Gizra Way</a></strong>.
          It is a culmination of best practices, lessons learned, and open-source

                  Our clients have full access to a detailed breakdown of the project tasks,
                  the code repositories, and task-tracking system. This means that the our 
                  time management, internal communications and actions are in full view to 
                  the client. We like it this way because it fosters an environment 
                  of collaboration, openness, and accountability.

                  With <a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/budget-goggles/" target="_blank">budget goggles</a>, 
                  we create a common language and set expectations early on.  Our clients are encouraged to participate 
                  fully in the development process, interacting directly with developers
                  of all levels. All stakeholders stay up to date on progress, 
                  and decision making occurs in real time according to the clientâ€™s needs and priorities.

                  A complete deployment and testing system is built into our projects
                  from day one, growing as the code does. We use <a href="http://shoov.io/" target="_blank">Shoov</a>, a Gizra developed
                  testing toolkit, which ensures design is optimal from visual, interaction,
                  and technical standpoints. The final design is completed with pixel-perfect implementation.
