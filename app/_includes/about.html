        <p>
          Gizra has developed a unique work methodology called 
          <strong><a href="#gizra-way" class="smooth-scroll-to">The Gizra Way</a></strong>.
          It is a culmination of best practices, lessons learned, and open-source

          clients money and ensuring the timely delivery of a product.

          of their web solution, but in the way we get there.
