        <p>
          A modern website is the application of a solution, and to get to that application requires a strategy. 
          Gizra employs a lean, yet comprehensive, discovery process that puts the client’s needs first, seeks 
          to understand the users, and determine the appropriate tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way we partner with you should also be exact and therefore our  strategy and consulting models 
          are designed to specifically fit your company’s digital needs.

                At the discovery phase, we partner with you to clarify 
                your objectives and determine the best tools and way to get there.  At the end of the discovery 
                phase, you will have a clear vision and a detailed task and budget breakdown.  We can also step 
                into a project at different points of the journey, from start to finish or at a specific 
                point that requires some extra attention.

                Your organization is really good at what they do and 
                require the right technology strategy to support it.  Depending on your organization’s requirements, 
                this would occur with close partnership with your CTO or fill the position if required.
