                <p class="list-group-item-text">A website isn’t simply a product - it’s the application 
                  of a solution, and to get to that application requires a strategy. Gizra employs a lean, 
                  yet comprehensive, discovery process that puts the client’s needs first, seeks to 
                  understand the user stories, and quickly determines the appropriate tools for the job. 
                  Our strategic development process comes from years of experience in finding simple human 
                  solutions to complex technical challenges. </p>

                  a singular purpose: to engage a user in an experience with your content. That experience 
                  can take many forms - it may be very complicated, or quite simple, but at the end of the 
                  day, when the last piece of code is committed, we should be left with an uncomplicated 
                  relationship between your users and your website.</p>
