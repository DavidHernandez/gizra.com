          OpenScholar is a solution to the Babel Tower problem many higher learning establishments face. <br/>
          Rather than having multiple department, staff and project websites written in a multitude of environments,
          OpenScholar provides a single, open source codebase for easily creating and maintaining academic websites,
          based on the field-proven Drupal CMS.
